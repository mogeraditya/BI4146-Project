Intermediate Goal: Markov Model


The goal of the project is to build a Markov Model classifier for determining if the given DNA sequence shows promoter activity or not. 
The code takes the order of the markov model, the number of folds for cross-validation and the sequences for training and testing as inputs. The user can also set the number of thresholds they want to use to plot to the roc-curve. 
The final output of the code is the roc curves for each cross-validation fold, the precision-recall curve for each cross-validation fold and the average area under the roc-curves for all cross validation folds.
